PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM:
The purpose of the program is to simulate a scenerio where
baby eagles are eating from pots that are refilled by a
mother eagle.  

HOW TO COMPILE THE PROGRAM:
Type "make" into the command line console.  The make file 
will compile the program and run the executable.

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM FROM THE SHELL:
Type the following into the console:
	"eaglefeed <number of pots> <number of babies> <number of feedings>"

WHAT EXACTLY THE PROGRAM DOES:
The program uses semaphores and mutex locks to maximize concurrency between 
hungry baby eagles feeding on the food in the pots and the mother filling
those pots.  There's also a lock to control printing to the output console.

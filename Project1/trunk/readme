####################################
 The purpose of your program
####################################
The program graphexec will be responsible for analyzing a graph of user programs, determining which ones are eligible to run, and running programs
that are eligible to run at that moment in time. As programs in the graph finish, your program will determine which other programs in the graph have become eligible to run, execute those programs, and continue this process until all programs are finished.

####################################
 How to compile the program
####################################

To compile:

make 

//this will be default run clean.  It also creates blank.txt and blank-file.txt used in testing.  Without creating these files, none of the nodes will return a correct exit status and some outputs may not be correct

To clean:

make clean

//This will remove all *.txt files


####################################
 How to use the program from the shell (syntax)
####################################

$ ./graphexec some-graph-file.txt

note: the program assumes that dependent input files already exist.  Otherwise a node will not correctly finish

####################################
Expected Output
####################################  

$ ./graphexec ./testFiles/testgraph1.txt

-----------------------
node numberParents
0    0

Total Nodes Read=5

Node 0: adding to readyq
Node 1: adding to ineligibleq

Node 3: adding to ineligibleq
Node 4: adding to ineligibleq
Node 0: forked as pid 16247
Node 0: exited, WIFEXITED(status)=0,pid=16247,finished
Node 0: adding to finishedq
finishq has 1 nodes
Node 1: adding to readyq
Node 1: forked as pid 16248
Node 1: exited, WIFEXITED(status)=0,pid=16248,finished
Node 1: adding to finishedq
finishq has 2 nodes
Node 2: adding to readyq
Node 3: adding to readyq
Node 3: forked as pid 16249
Node 2: forked as pid 16250
Node 3: exited, WIFEXITED(status)=0,pid=16249,finished
Node 2: adding to finishedq
finishq has 3 nodes
Node 2: exited, WIFEXITED(status)=0,pid=16250,finished
Node 3: adding to finishedq
finishq has 4 nodes
Node 4: adding to readyq
Node 4: forked as pid 16251
Node 4: exited, WIFEXITED(status)=0,pid=16251,finished
Node 4: adding to finishedq
finishq has 5 nodes
---------------------------------------------------
Number of nodes in finishq(5) = nodes read(5)
All jobs considered Complete !!!
---------------------------------------------------

####################################
 What exactly your program does
####################################  
Basic idea is that each node's information is added to the following maps

name            key     value
--------------- ---     --------------------
allNodesMap     id      node
numParents      id      numParents
 
-  if numParents[id]=0, then the node is added to ready queue. 
-  when each node completes execution, for each element in allNodesMap[id].children the numParents[child] is decremented 1.  If this value is equal to 0 then move to ready queue.
-  execute all jobs in ready queue, move running jobs to finishq
-  repeat until all jobs in finishq

This gives an O(V+E) because populating the numParents is O(V+E).  Otherwise, every other operation is O(V).  This is equivalent complexity to a Topological sort, but unlike topological support it allows for execution parallelism in the process dependencies.
